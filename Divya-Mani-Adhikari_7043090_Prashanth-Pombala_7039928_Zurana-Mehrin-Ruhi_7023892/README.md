# Instructions
The set up for the project is very simple. First open a terminal and create a virtual environment.
`python -m venv venv`
Then, activate the virtual environment using,
`source venv/bin/activate`
Next, install the necessary libraries for the project which are listed in `requirements.txt` file.
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
Some packages will be installed as well when the notebook is run. Next, we need to launch Jupyter lab interface to run our notebook. From the directory that contains the `.ipynb` file, run
`jupyter lab`
This will launch a browser window of Jupyter lab. From the left bar, select the project notebook file to open it and then run the cells to test the project.

The project was implemented on Google Colab (Python 3.9).
